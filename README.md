# Jira Reporting App

This is an app I created to help run some automated reporting from Jira.

Our team is split into multiple smaller dev teams assigned to different projects. This app tracks some crucial sprint data across multiple projects.

Their API was a bit of a headache, but I wanted to be able to, with a click of a button, use their API to pull some data via their JQL syntax and then organize it in a viewable/printable format.
